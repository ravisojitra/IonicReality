00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.089
This is a cardinal sin of EDM right here.

2
00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.559
Dive in and say "Hey I'm a trance DJ and

3
00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.300
I can hit one note but a bass drum on it

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.000
and that's my tune".

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.119
This class is just a good primer for anyone wanting to get

6
00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.910
into the production of electronic music.

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.980
This can all be done correctly with

8
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.830
minimal amount of software which is why

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.000
you can have a kid make a dance hit on a laptop.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.340
Using an SSL G series compressor

11
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.820
on a dance music kick makes no sense

12
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.750
whatsoever.

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.520
Ninety percent of my time is just

14
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.170
goofing around and trying to come up

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.239
with something. That's the way I go about

16
00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.070
making music because I'm just completely like

17
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.450
I want my first chord to go there.

18
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.580
That's my life right now because if I

19
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.080
could just play it I'd play it but I

20
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.000
can't so I have to draw it.

21
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.320
If you're not naturally comfortable on stage. from my

22
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.210
own personal experience. you should try

23
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.940
putting on a helmet. That covers your face.

24
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.000
So you don't have to see anyone.

25
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.520
I could teach someone how to get. you know. from nothing

26
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.830
to something. When you come up with an

27
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.750
idea that you've never actually heard before

28
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.119
or have never heard anyone do

29
00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.500
that's something really cool.

30
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.509
This class is designed for you to

31
00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.670
develop your own style and developing

32
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.690
your own sound.

33
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.560
If you can impact one person with your

34
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.660
music then it is pretty much worth it.

35
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.850
Sometimes it happens in five years.

36
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.110
sometimes it happens in 10 years.

37
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.730
sometimes it doesn't happen at all.

38
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.110
But it's definitely one-hundred percent not going to

39
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.790
happen if you don't go out there and

40
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.000
try it for yourself.

41
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.060
I'm deadmau5 and this is my MasterClass.
